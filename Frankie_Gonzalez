## Frankie's project idea
--- 
My idea for this project is to show the difference in speed and time of a rocket getting launced from Earth compared to getting launced from Mars.

##**Background/ Motivation**:
I am motivated to solve this problem because as an engineer i love solving these types of problems that involve space.
The average gravitational pull of the Earth is 9.8 meters per second squared (m/s2). The Earth is made of different substances like air, rock, and water. These substances have a different amount of mass in a certain amount of space (density). For example, rock has a higher density than air.

It is weaker than Earth's gravity due to the planet's smaller mass. The average gravitational acceleration on Mars is 3.72076 m/s2 (about 38% of the gravity of Earth) and it varies.

Objective: The objective is to show the difference in speed and time of a rocket getting launced from Earth compared to getting launced from Mars. The goal is to collect data on the diffrent velocities of the rockets while having the same mass.
###1) What is the velocity of the rocket leaving Earth? 2) What is the velocity of the rocket leaving Mars? 3) What is the difference in time as they leave the atmosphere? 4) Does weather play a big factor?
