## Frankie's project idea
--- 
My idea for this project is to show the difference in speed and time of a rocket getting launced from Earth compared to getting launced from Mars.

##**Background/ Motivation**:
I am motivated to solve this problem because as an engineer i love solving these types of problems that involve space.
The average gravitational pull of the Earth is 9.8 meters per second squared (m/s2). The Earth is made of different substances like air, rock, and water. These substances have a different amount of mass in a certain amount of space (density). For example, rock has a higher density than air.

It is weaker than Earth's gravity due to the planet's smaller mass. The average gravitational acceleration on Mars is 3.72076 m/s2 (about 38% of the gravity of Earth) and it varies.
